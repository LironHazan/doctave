For more information visit the Doctave original docs.

Motivation: To be able to use Doctave with npx for a smaller footprint. 

** Disclaimer: This package is aligned with [my personal fork](https://github.com/LironHazan/doctave) and thus could produce a slightly different output. 

----------

Doctave is an opinionated documentation site generator that converts your Markdown files into
a beautiful documentation site with minimal effort.

Doctave is not a generic static site generator - it is only meant for generating documentation sites
from Markdown. This allows the tool to be much simpler than other solutions, with fewer
configuration steps.

This open source tool is built and maintained by [Doctave.com](https://www.doctave.com).
